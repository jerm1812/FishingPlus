# FishingPlus
Have you ever fealt that there is no point in fishing in Minecraft? Are you tired of catching the same fish over and over again? Fishing Plus makes fishing what you want it to be.

### Competitions
With Fishing Plus, you can start your own fishing competitions based off of your newly created fish lengths. The winner of each competition will be rewarded with the prizes that you set in the configuration. If a competition is set to run for only a sertain amount of time, a boss bar will show the remaining time of the competition. 

You can either start your own competitions or let them automaticly run by settings the times you want it to in the configuration file.

### Fishing Rewards
When you are creating the items to fish up, you are not limited to just fish! You can have whatever items you want with its own name, lore, and commands that run when catching that item. When defining the chance to catch a specific fishing reward, it is out of the total weight so you do not need to worry about totalling up to a specific number.

If you wish for a reward to be a fish than you can set a minimum and maximum that the length for each fish will be. Or if you would prefer that it just be a regular item with a custom name, lore, and commands just leave the length out!

Ever wanted to fish up some custom potions with the effects that you define? If so, I have good news for you! You can not only set the potion effects on the potion but also the color of that potion.

### Rarity Modifiers
You can create your own rarity modifiers for every item! If you want a fishing reward to have a chance of getting a rarity just add that fish's name to the specific rarity modifier in the config.

### Custom Textures
If you think the fish are still just too plain, you can create your own custom textures by setting the custome model data in the config. (Tutorial on how to do this will come soon)
